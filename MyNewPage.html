<p>ABOUT US 
We started this website 2 years ago during the pandemic. For years we've been collecting managa books and vintage shirts from all animes from the early 1900s-2000s. 
We never had in mind to do with the collection and both had in mind that this generaion would be in for a treat. There's a lot of young kids that are into manga even adults too who grew up watching Toonami. 
As far as anime has grown over the years in the world we decided to sell our collectiables on as a side hobby. At first we thought it could be a side hustle for time being during pandemic. 
We started our Instagram page and with the help of the government of US giving citizens stimulus checks and for the past few months we haven't receieved any buyers we were on a verge of quitting the shop but 
one day in the middle of the year we recieved our first customer. Few days later 10 more came around , then 50 then hundred and thousands. We were so happy that our page was growing . 
We didn't have a clue that this much people in the world would choose to buy books and toys from us . Several months later beginning of 2021 we decided to plan out our first shop date and it took us a while for risk of 
customers' health and employees. Currently sitting in 2022 beginning of May we have launched our first shop in our hometown of Boston,Massachusetts. We have lots of merchandise, collectiables in the future . We are very blessed 
to have the opportunity to share this moment with anime fans throughout the world .
